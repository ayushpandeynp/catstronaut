# Catsronaut: A Space Odyssey
This story is a cat-themed space exploration adventure, depicted through an interactive comic website. The protagonist is a cat who embarks on a journey to the moon.

## Story
Our protagonist, a cat, looks up at the moon every night, wondering what lies far beyond its earthly home. One day, the cat finds an opportunity to become an astronaut and, without a second thought, seizes this chance. It undergoes training and prepares to board a rocket. Finally, the cat travels about 238,000 miles to reach the moon, where it looks up and sees the Earth from a new perspective.

## Comic Design
The comics were sketched by Ian based on an idea that came up during our class discussions. The sketches use a vibrant set of colors to ensure that the panels match with the background and the overall aesthetics of the website.

## Sound
To craft the soundtrack for this comic, Stefan laid down a foundational chord progression in a major key, capturing the lively and spirited essence of cats. He then layered arcade-inspired synth leads and bass to infuse the composition with a science fiction ambiance, employing the distinctive timbres of digital instruments. The track is designed to evoke a sense of excitement and exploration, reflecting the adventurous spirit of the narrative.

## Website
For the website, we have embraced a space theme that complements the comic story's narrative. Although the styling is straightforward, the interactivity is a crucial element in advancing the story. As users scroll down, the comic panels are revealed sequentially, enhancing the storytelling experience and engaging the reader in the protagonist's journey through space.
