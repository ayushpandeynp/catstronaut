# Catstronaut: A Space Odyssey
This story is a cat-themed space exploration adventure, depicted through an interactive comic website. The protagonist is a cat who embarks on a journey to the moon.

## Story
Our protagonist, a cat, looks up at the moon every night, wondering what lies far beyond its earthly home. One day, the cat finds an opportunity to become an astronaut and, without a second thought, seizes this chance. It undergoes training and prepares to board a rocket. Finally, the cat travels about 238,000 miles to reach the moon, where it looks up and sees the Earth from a new perspective.

## Process
The project was a collaborative effort among our team members, each contributing their unique skills to bring the concept to life:

### Comic Design
Ian sketched the comics based on our class discussions, using a vibrant color palette to ensure that the panels matched the website's overall aesthetics.

### Sound
To craft the soundtrack for this comic, Stefan laid down a foundational chord progression in a major key, capturing the lively and spirited essence of cats. He then layered arcade-inspired synth leads and bass to infuse the composition with a science fiction ambiance, employing the distinctive timbres of digital instruments. The track is designed to evoke a sense of excitement and exploration, reflecting the adventurous spirit of the narrative.

### Website
Ayush focused on the website design, ensuring that the space theme complemented the narrative of the comic story. He implemented interactive elements to reveal the comic panels sequentially as users scroll down, enhancing the storytelling experience.

## Reflection
Reflecting on the project, we successfully achieved our goal of creating an engaging and immersive experience. The collaboration between team members allowed us to blend different artistic elements seamlessly, resulting in a cohesive final product. The interactive website design, in particular, played a crucial role in bringing the story to life, allowing users to feel like they were part of the cat's journey through space. Overall, the project has met our expectations, and we love it!
